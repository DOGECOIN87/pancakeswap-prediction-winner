#### PancakeSwap is afraid of this! This bot is a casino winner! This bot wins almost every 5 minute BNB-USD option on PancakeSwap Prediction and BTC-USD option on CandleGenie. Supports all modern browsers. Secured by default.

#### IMPORTANT! Open Extensions -> Developer Mode ON -> PancakeSwap Prediction Winner -> service worker. Otherwise the bot will sleep.

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Start

The fastest way to start with the bot is the Chrome Extension version.

- Enter your private key and bet amount and click "Set" button. Your private key is **securely** stored on your local machine.

- Choose PancakeSwap or CandleGenie at the bottom of the bot

- Click "Start The Bot" and just wait. Bot will do everything automatically. He will even collect the awards himself.

- You can use any site, most importantly, do not make any transactions, because you can break the bot timer
